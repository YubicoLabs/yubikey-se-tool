=== Tools & Utilities

Currently, the YubiKey SE Tool allows:

==== U2F Preregistration
This tool allows for U2F preregistration on a YubiKey. It outputs preregistration data in a standard TSV format, as follows:

```
    1. Serial # (decimal)
    2. AppId (32 hex encoded bytes)
    3. Challenge (base64 encoded - same as client data hash)
    4. PublicKey (base64 encoded)
    5. KeyHandle (urlsafe base64 encoded)
    6. Signature (base64 encoded ANSI X9.62/SEC1 ECDSA P256)
    7. Attestation Certificate (base64 encoded X509 DER)
    8. Timestamp - (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss  - ex: 2018-01-01T12:34:56)
```

If the TSV file selected already exists, the new preregistration data will be appended.
