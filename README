==== U2F Preregistration
This tool allows for U2F preregistration on a YubiKey. It outputs preregistration data in a standard TSV format, as follows:

```
    1. Timestamp - (2018-01-01T12:34:56)
    2. Serial # - (decimal)
    3. Appid - (hex)
    4. Challenge (base64)
    5. Public Point (base64)
    6. Key Handle (base64)
    7. Registration Signature (urlsafebase64)
    8. Attestation Certificate (base64)
```

If the TSV file selected already exists, the new preregistration data will be appended.
